Hi there. Thank you for taking a look at one of my projects. It's really simple, all you have to do is put in a city that is in the US
and you'll be able to see the current weather, 5 day forecast, and a 7-day forecast for the UV index. As a bonus,
there's a nice picture that changes with the weather.

Thanks to openweathermap.com and GithubPages.

Enjoy!
